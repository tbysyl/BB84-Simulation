This code simulates the BB84 protocol in Python. As of the first commit, it only runs Alice to Bob.

The code has support for:
-Custom basis angles (not applicable to BB84)
-Viewing stats
-Averaging the key length to verify the expectation value of key length (N/2)

This code is semi-heuristic and is not optimal. It is entirely for demonstartion purposes and cannot be used to implement BB84 properly.
